global vbq_def

%% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Global parameters %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% Specifying the lab
vbq_def.centre = 'lren' ; % but could be 'fil' or 'lren'

%% Some other global parameters
vbq_def.param1 = '123' ;
vbq_def.param2 = '456' ;

%% Specific set of parameters, SET1
vbq_def.set1.prefix = 'a'; % when a char is specified
vbq_def.set1.val1   = 1; % setting a single value

%% Specific set of parameters, SET2
vbq_def.set2.prefix = 'b'; % when a char is specified
vbq_def.set2.val1   = 2; % setting a single value


%% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Centre specific parameters %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% Note the centre specific defaults structure 
% - they should all have the *same* organization, otherwise crashes could 
%    occure when trying to access the default value in the batch.
% - they should NOT have anything similar with the 'global' defaults.
%   For example do NOT define "vbq_def.TE = 20" and "vbq_def.fil.TE = 30" 
%   fields as the latter would NEVER be used
